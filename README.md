# Hulu Clone

This application is a replica of [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) which is majority-owned by the [Walt Design Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company). This clone is built using Javascript frameworks like React, and Next and a CSS utility framework called TailwindCSS. The [Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API is a community-built movie and TV database that is used to systematically retrieve details about movies, TV shows/seasons, actors, and more. The API is offered by TMDB for free, and one can obtain an API key by signing into their TMDB account.

## üöÄ Usage

The usage of a Hulu clone that fetches data from the TMDB API and utilizes server-side rendering can be understood from the following points:

- **Content Display**: The clone can showcase a vast array of movies, TV shows, and other multimedia content sourced directly from the TMDB database.
- **Real-time Data**: With the TMDB API, the clone is equipped to display real-time information about movies and TV shows, ensuring users see the latest data.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Server-side rendering ensures faster initial page load times, offering users a snappier experience, especially for content-rich pages.
- **SEO Optimization**: SSR improves the site's search engine optimization. Since search engines receive fully rendered pages, it can index the site more effectively, beneficial for attracting organic traffic.
- **Categorized Viewing**: Users can browse content based on genres, popularity, release dates, and other categories, providing a more organized and tailored viewing experience.
- **Improved User Experience**: The combination of real-time data fetching and server-side rendering means users get a seamless browsing experience without long loading times or stale data.
- **Responsive Design**: Like Hulu, the clone can be designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various device types and screen sizes.

### Next.js Authentication

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) offers an integrated approach to user authentication in React applications, and it has been leveraged in this Facebook clone for several reasons:

Session Management:
- With Next.js, sessions are managed efficiently. Once a user logs in, their session details are retained securely, ensuring they remain authenticated until they opt to log out or their session naturally expires.
Extensibility with Third-party Providers:
- This clone is structured in a way that it can potentially allow users to sign in using third-party providers such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter, all thanks to the flexibility of Next.js authentication.
Enhanced Security:
- Security is paramount, especially for platforms like Facebook. Therefore, all passwords are hashed and salted; plain text storage is avoided at all costs.
