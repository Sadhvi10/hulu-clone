# Hulu Clone

This application is a replica of [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) which is majority-owned by the [Walt Design Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company). This clone is built using Javascript frameworks like React, and Next and a CSS utility framework called TailwindCSS. The [Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API is a community-built movie and TV database that is used to systematically retrieve details about movies, TV shows/seasons, actors, and more. The API is offered by TMDB for free, and one can obtain an API key by signing into their TMDB account.
